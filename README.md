Edison Edware for PC/Mac/Linux/Raspberry Pi
===========================================

Repository for the development of PC software to program the Edison
robot -- see [Meet Edison](http://meetedison.com) for the awesome robot.

This software is derived from Bricworks created in 2006 to program
Microbric's Ai2 robot. The code therefore, still has lots of elements
from Bricworks so isn't a clean, well organised, code base :(.

Look into the EdWare_src/docs directory for more documentation.

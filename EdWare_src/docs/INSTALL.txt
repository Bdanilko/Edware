Notes on installing EdWare software

*** Windows with installer ************

The windows installer contains all code that's needed to run EdWare in a single
executable created with PyInstaller and Inno. The file will be in the form:
edwaresetup-x.y.z.exe (where x, y and z is the version number of the software).

To install, just unzip the file (if it's zipped) and then run the .exe file. It will
install the program for you.

*** OSX with installer ****************

The OSX installer contains all the code that's needed to run EdWare in a single
disk image, created with PyInstaller. The file will be in the form:
edwaresetup-x.y.z.dmg (where x, y and z is the version number of the software).

Double click the .dmg file to mount it. Then the .app file inside can be dragged over to
Applications or run directly from the mounted disk image.

*** Linux manually ********************

Depending your linux distribution, the details of installing software from your
package manager will vary. Please investigate how to install packages for your
linux distribution.

First try to find the packages mentioned below (except for EdWare!) in your
distribution's package manage and install them from there. If you can't find them
there, then go to the websites listed to install them manually.

1) Install the latest version 2 of python
   (version 2.7.9, https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   
2) Install the wxPython version that matches your python 
   (version http://wxpython.org/download.php#linux)
   
3) Install the PyAudio version that matches your python
   (http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads)

3.1) Alsa and it's plugins must be installed for the sound output
   (particularly libasound_module_conf_pulse.so). This is normal on
   most linux distributions, but must be installed if absent.

4) Install the JsonPickle version that matches your python version
   (http://jsonpickle.github.io/#download-install)
   
5) Pick or create a directory to hold EdWare (say under your home directory)
   (e.g. cd ~ ; mkdir edware)
   
6) Unzip the EdWare source into this directory
   (e.g. cd edware ; unzip ../EdWareSrc-x.y.z.zip)
   
7) Execute edware , in this new directory, by typing: "python edware.py"
   (e.g. cd ~/edware ; python2 edware.py)

Note -- if you have both python 3 and python 2 installed, you may have to invoke
edware by typing: "python2 edware.py".

NOTE -- a user contributed this info (edited to add libasound): 
     for Ubuntu 14.04, install the needed packages with:
     apt-get install python-jsonpickle python-pyaudio python-wxgtk2.8 libasound2-plugins

Notes on installing EdWare software

*** Windows with installer ************

The windows installer contains all code that's needed to run EdWare in a single
executable created with PyInstaller and Inno. The file will be in the form:
edwaresetup-x.y.z.exe (where x, y and z is the version number of the software).

To install, just unzip the file (if it's zipped) and then run the .exe file. It will
install the program for you.

*** OSX with installer ****************

The OSX installer contains all the code that's needed to run EdWare in a single
disk image, created with PyInstaller. The file will be in the form:
edwaresetup-x.y.z.dmg (where x, y and z is the version number of the software).

Double click the .dmg file to mount it. Then the .app file inside can be dragged over to
Applications or run directly from the mounted disk image.

*** Linux manually ********************

Depending your linux distribution, the details of installing software from your
package manager will vary. Please investigate how to install packages for your
linux distribution.

First try to find the packages mentioned below (except for EdWare!) in your
distribution's package manage and install them from there. If you can't find them
there, then go to the websites listed to install them manually.

1) Install the latest version 2 of python
   (version 2.7.9, https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   
2) Install the wxPython version that matches your python 
   (version http://wxpython.org/download.php#linux)
   
3) Install the PyAudio version that matches your python
   (http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads)
   [NOTE -- pygame can be used instead of pyaudio]

3.1) Alsa and it's plugins must be installed for the sound output
   (particularly libasound_module_conf_pulse.so). This is normal on
   most linux distributions, but must be installed if absent.

4) Install the JsonPickle version that matches your python version
   (http://jsonpickle.github.io/#download-install)
   
5) Pick or create a directory to hold EdWare (say under your home directory)
   (e.g. cd ~ ; mkdir edware)
   
6) Unzip the EdWare source into this directory
   (e.g. cd edware ; unzip ../EdWareSrc-x.y.z.zip)
   
7) Execute edware , in this new directory, by typing: "python edware.py"
   (e.g. cd ~/edware ; python edware.py)

Note -- if you have both python 3 and python 2 installed, you may have to invoke
edware by typing: "python2 edware.py".

8) From here on, just need to open a terminal window, go to the edware directory
   and type "python edware.py" (or "python2 edware.py")


NOTE -- a user contributed this info (edited to add libasound): 
     for Ubuntu 14.04, install the needed packages with:
     apt-get install python-jsonpickle python-pyaudio python-wxgtk2.8 libasound2-plugins


*** Raspberry PI manually **********************

First setup Raspian if you haven't already:
   a) Installed Raspian from NOOBs using (language: English UK, Keyboard: US)

   b) Reboot

   c) In raspi-config (which automatically comes up on first boot):
      - 3. Set to use desktop login
      - Under advanced options, set audio to go out 3.5" plug
      - Finished and then reboot

1) After logging in, open a terminal window. All input will be typed there.

2) In the terminal window, to set audio output through audio jack,
   type: "amixer cset numid=3 1"

3) In the terminal window, run "alsamixer" to set the volume

4) In the terminal window, type "apt-get install python-jsonpickle python-wxgtk2.8"
   [Note -- pygame is already installed, and will be used,
    but if you would prefer to use pyaudio then ALSO do:
    apt-get install python-pyaudio]

5) Pick or create a directory to hold EdWare (say under your home directory)
   (e.g. cd ~ ; mkdir edware)
   
6) Unzip the EdWare source into this directory
   (e.g. cd edware ; unzip ../EdWareSrc-x.y.z.zip)
   
7) Execute edware , in this new directory, by typing: "python edware.py"
   (e.g. cd ~/edware ; python edware.py)

8) From here on, just need open a terminal window, go to the edware directory
   and type "python edware.py"

*** Choosing different audio outputs **********************

Currently EdWare can use 3 different audio backends. They are:
a) Windows built-in (only on windows)
b) Portaudio        (from package python-pyaudio)
c) Pygame audio     (from package python-pygame)

If Pyaudio is installed, then it will be used. If it isn't installed but Pygame is then
it will be used. If neither is installed, but you are running on windows then the windows
built-in audio will be used. If neither is installed, and you aren't running windows then
EdWare will stop as it can't program Edison without audio.

If have both installed, or you want to test the different backends, then you can override
which audio backend to use. When invoking EdWare type:
python edware.py -a pygame (to force using pygame), or
python edware.py -a portaudio (to force using portaudio).

Note that the package must be installed (python-pyaudio, python-pygame) before you can force
EdWare to use it.

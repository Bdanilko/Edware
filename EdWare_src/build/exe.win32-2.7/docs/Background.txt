* Background of EdWare

EdWare is a multi-OS program used to create programs for the
Edison robot from MicroBric Pty. Ltd.. 

** Features
EdWare was created to allow creating programs in a graphical format,
so that non-programmers of all ages could write programs for their
robots. 

To that end, EdWare was created using a cross-platform language - python. It allows
for one program to be used on multiple OSs -- specifically Linux, Macs, and Windows.
For the graphics, a cross platform library called wxWidgets was used. It has bindings
for python, is freely available, runs on the three OSs, and had all of the graphical
widgets that were needed.

Edison is programmed with 'tokens' that the firmware in Edison knows how to interpret.
These tokens are described in the tokens1.html file in this directory. These tokens
allow for setting/reading variables, setting/reading registers to control the robot,
general control constructs, etc. 

Tokens, though, are too low level for the typical user/programmer, so EdWare presents
the user with 'Brics', to control the robot. When the user is done arranging the
Brics, then EdWare, outputs an 'assembler' program, which is then assembled to the
tokens to be dowloaded to Edison. The format for the assembler source is documented
in the token_assembler.txt file in this directory. The guts of the assembler is within
the gui program, but a standalone python program, tass.py, also exists which can
assemble an EdWare program into a binary representation of the tokens.

As the binary representation of the tokens is transmitted over an audio channel, there
is an internal python routine which creates a wav file. Like the tass.py standalone 
program, another standalone python program will be created to create wav files
from binaries.

** Origins - 
EdWare was originally called BricWorks and was written in 2006 for the BricWorks
Ai2 robot. That robot allowed for different modules to be connected in different 
locations to make a custom robot. This flexibility (which is not in Edison) made
BricWorks much more complex then is needed for Edison. 

As EdWare grew out of BricWorks, some code that isn't needed now is still in
place. The goal was to minimise changes instead of doing unnecessary rewriting.
This allowed us to get a programming environment for Edison very quickly.
